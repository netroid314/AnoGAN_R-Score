# This is repository for Ajou Univ research project: Improving anomaly data classification performance of AnoGAN via improved anomaly score computation using object size.<br/><br/>If you want to see more details, please watch video in Ajou Univ Softcon.
## Caution: Some files are not uploaded because of solving some kind of compatibility problem and file size problem
## Caution: I removed all supplementary and unnecessary codes for better readability.<br/>
